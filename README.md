# RampMapper
This project we're going to model all university's main locations (classrooms, cafeterias, etc) that can be accessed by a ramp, this in order to help disabled people get to their desired location. While helping disable people get around the university, this will show how well ICESI is performing disability-inclusive design and drive to improvement.
